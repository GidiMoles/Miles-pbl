# INSTALL EXPRESSJS

Remember that Express is a framework for Node.js, therefore a lot of things developers would have programmed is already taken care of out of the box. Therefore it simplifies development, and abstracts a lot of low level details. For example, Express helps to define routes of your application based on HTTP methods and URLs.

To use express, install it using npm

# MODELS

A model is at the heart of JavaScript based applications, and it is what makes it interactive. We will also use models to define the database schema

# MONGODB DATABASE

We need a database where we will store our data. For this we will make use of mLab. mLab provides MongoDB database as a service solution (DBaaS). sign up on https://www.mongodb.com/atlas-signup-from-mlab. Follow the sign up process, select AWS as the cloud provider, and choose a region near you.
